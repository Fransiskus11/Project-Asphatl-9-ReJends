# 🚀 Project Asphalt 9: ReJends - Web Frontend

## Project Overview
**Asphalt 9: ReJends** is a multi-page front-end website project created as a tribute to the popular racing game *Asphalt 9: Legends*.  
Developed as a university assignment, this project aims to capture the game's immersive, high-energy aesthetic within a dynamic and interactive web experience.

## ✨ Key Features
This project is more than just a landing page; it's a feature-rich website that includes:

- **Home Page (`home.html`)**: An engaging entry point with an automated image carousel and detailed sections covering game modes, features, and objectives.
- **Car Gallery (`gallery.html`)**: An interactive gallery where users can browse vehicles, dynamically filtered by class (S, A, B, etc.). Car data is loaded and displayed using JavaScript.
- **News Page (`news.html`)**: A section for game updates, featuring a "Load More" button to dynamically reveal older news articles.
- **Esports Hub (`esport.html`)**: A dedicated page for the competitive scene, complete with a video trailer, statistics, and information on regional and world stages.
- **Subscription Forms (`subscriptionViewer.html` & `subscriptionCreator.html`)**: Two distinct, validated forms for viewers and content creators to subscribe, demonstrating robust form handling and user input validation with JavaScript.
